<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="who-i-am">Who I am</h2>
<p>My name is Salvador Guzman and I intend to revolutionize pedagogy. As a proud graduate from UCSB’s undergraduate program, I intend to take the lessons I learned from my experiences as a student with me and augment the efficacy of education for the benefit of future scholars.</p>
<h2 id="mission-statement">Mission Statement</h2>
<p>My degree in Computer Science, Bacherlor’s of Science, confers a profound vantage point from which I can the future of education unfold. With my academic specialty as a life long self-learner, and my technical expertise from being on the bleeding of technological development, I want to be part of the generations of teachers that usher in the next era of pedagogical developments. And with my passion for education, social astuteness and my initiative-taking proclivities, I am the best candidate to bear the burdern of bringing the subsequent age of pedagogical progress to fruition.</p>
<h2 id="nature-of-this-document">Nature of this document</h2>
<p>The following is my notes concerning my application to the Alder Graduate School of Education teacher residency program. They are written by me for the purposes of structuring what my presention will consist of. They are organized and structurally outlined in response to the document presented to me prior to the interview. Thus, each section will explicitly reference the relevant document.</p>

<li><p>Planning and Assessment</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Identifies a clear purpose or objective (written on</li>
</ul>
<p>lesson plan, board, or verbally stated)</p>
<p>Compile relevant state education goals and objects that describe pedagogical relevant goals. Produce documentation that outlines the intersection between formal objective goals and my preferred educational objectives. With that documetation in hand, I will then present that information to the students. Since I will be closely following the contours of the document, this will be relevant information that should be readily accessible to the students. I will provide that information digitally in the form of website but also have on hand paper versions in case the students would like a hard-copy to peruse at their own leisure.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>B. Organizes a clear, rational plan to meet that objective (either turns in a lesson plan or writes/posts an agenda)</p>
<p>As state before I, I have ambitious curriculum plans for my prospective</p></li>
</ul>
<p>classes. I am very much of the mind that advance material, specifically but not limited to mathematics, can be presented to younger students. I know this is possible not just based on recent pedagogical developments but from my own experiences of learning higher mathematics by myself. Given that I taught myself advance mathematics solely from resources found on the internet for no other reason than for the pleasure of knowing, I know how to pedagogically structure a curriculum to accomplish learning objects competently.</p>
<p>That said, I understand the nature of the offical environment that I will be operating in. Ultimately, I am a servant of the Californian education establishment and thus will serve in that capacity in the classroom. Despite whatever idealistic of lofty ambitions may accompany me on my journey to be an instructor, I will nevertheless be responsible for faithfully executing the the pedagogical goals of the state of California. California justly prides itself in being a leader in educational development and provides the perfect environment for achieving long term education outcomes. Our students, who come from many and diverse backgrounds, should demand the best that modern pedagogical instruction has to offer. And regardless of family economic and social status, all of our future scholars should be able to achieve educational attainment given California’s ambitious education program.</p>
<p>Thus, I may be idealistic and passionate at heart, but I still hold myself accountable to the the aspirations of California.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>C. Plans a way to assess student mastery of objectives. (It is planned, it doesn’t have to be executed to get this point)</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the noble vision of the state of California’s education program and policy objectives, I will emphatically incorporate the use technology in the classroom. As a scholar of technology with a degree in a hard science, I have come to appreciate the place of technology in the modern world. To say that the modern world’s existence and maintenance is contingent on technology and the innovative progresion thereof is not emphasis enough. I see technology as a force for good that can wielded for the benefit of all.</p>
<p>Despite it’s the somewhat raptuous rhetoric that often accompanies corresponding discouse, there is some small amount of truth in the myths. I am of the opinion that whatever social dislocations that occur in society at large by the widespread will eventually be amelioated when we learn to adapt to to technology in a bilateral fashion. And intoducing technology early as part of the instuctional process will help students familiarize themselves with usage thereof. Students will come to see technology as a necessary aid and plan their lives around it. They will see technology for the miracle for it is and be better prepared for our technological future.</p>
<p>Thus, assessing students on mastery of objectives will preferably be computerized in some way, automated and accessible to the students in some way. Although I cannot present specifics, rest assured that whatever methods I have of evaluating academic performance will be as efficient as possible as to relieve myself of more free time to be able to spend with students.</p></li>
<li><p>D. Plans appropriately paced activities to meet the objective within allotted time. (finishes what they planned and pacing seems appropriate)</p>
<p>As aforementioned, tech will make a strong presence in my prospective classroom. Technology will feature in future designs I have in mind to objectively analysize and respond to course work loads.. As someone who has worked in a classroom setting for some time, I understand how the alotment of time is a serious concern. Ensuring one has the time to pursue whatever classroom setting objectives is of vital importance. Despite my idealistic temperament, I acknowledge that ultimately praticality sets the pace of what can be accomplished.</p>
<p>Given the use of technological pedagogical tools of instruction, I will measure how long students take to complete what assignments. This data will factor strongly in adapting curriculum plans to the students capacities and abilities. In this way, I can assign as course work that will accomplish any educational attainment goals, as well as comfortably dovetailing the abilities and talents of the batch of students that I work with.</p>
<p>The great aspect of such a system is that this pedagogical policy acclimation can be set differently depending on the types of students I interact with. This means I can easily maintain multiple policies for different classes without any forseeable challenges.</p>
<p>Although I am short on specific implementations of this strategy, as such a thing has failed to be realized in the classroom setting, I confident in my ability to either procure such a program through the attainment of education software, or develop my own such software. Something like that is feasible for me since I have a history of developing and delivering high quality software and can easily assemble my own team if needed.</p>
<p>I encourage you to pepper me with questions if anything of the aforementioned pedagogical strategies invite formal speculative elaboration. I would be more than happy to share my vision.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Learning Environment</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Creates a positive, respectful environment (interactions are respectful and positive)</li>
</ul>
<p>Attending all social settings wherein members possess different energy levels and temperaments is the necessity of ensuring that the intended pupose of said gatheing is functionally executed. What this refers to is the proper social conduct of the participants. When working with children, some degree of patience and composure is required. Given the general excitable character of youth, appropriate approaches must be developed with the specific pupose of maintaining social harmony.</p>
<p>Perfect relations are maybe not be achievable within the context and capacity of the classroom setting but such a proclamation should naturally invite some schema for maximizing the the smooth function of educational discouse. Thus, any action that interferes with instruction of the classroom merits a response from the teacher.</p>
<p>How will I achieve this objective? I will ensure that the classroom setting will be a site of learning and instruction of future scholars by preserving the sancitity of the learning environment. I will make the expectations of what sort of behavior is appropriate in the classroom. This information will be presented to the students and available as well in a formal document that students may reference at their leisure.</p>
<p>Formal guidelines for appropriate behavior will be made a communal “property.“ What this entails is that any behavior that is deemed to deviated from the formal guidelines will be interpreted as a violation of a communal norm. That is, a classroom is where students come to learn and the inability to compose oneself properly within that setting is a social injury.</p>
<p>While this sounds a bit speculative, with any specific implementation left tentatively pending for now, I prefer this communal approach to monitoring behavior. In this way, students will come to identify with the classroom and the pedagogical mission that is attempted therein. I want strongly for students to identify with the education establishment and see themselves as inheritors of a long and proud educational legacy. And presenting social deviation in this light will aid me to achieve that end. It will furthe the collectivization of the students and provide the motivation for them to see themselves as a group and to identify with their fellow students.</p>
<p>Please prod me further on this section. I would love to share my vision with you!</p>
<ul>
<li>B. Clearly explains rules and expectations</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated previously, I plan to present what the expectations are for the students in terms of behavior. The idea is that in order for them to receive a world class education, I will need their help to preserve the spirit of the classroom. Constituting that ensuring that students encourage their fellow students to follow the guidelines. Making me aware of instances of deviation of which I was not aware of is another useful thing that they will be able to help me with. Making them the spiritial guardians of social cohesion will yield an invaluable benefit in the classroom.</p>
<p>I will hold back on authoring specific guidelines for now as I would rather tailor them to the specific environment. Rest assured, the usual admonistments about treating fellow students with respect and respecting property or possessions that are not theirs would apply.</p>
<ul>
<li>C. Uses an attention getting signal</li>
</ul>
<p>Given my dependence on technology, it should not be a surprise that I will depend heavily on a digitalized presentation. This will include the use of but not limitation thereof of slide shows, computer demonstratons, and evocative graphical programs.</p>
<p>This is with the intention of completely engrossing the students in the curriculum. My assumption is that technology will capture their attention cohesively since the disposition of the students will be some prior interaction with technology already. This should aid me.</p>
<ul>
<li>D. Prepares materials (visuals, handouts, and/or kinesthetic learning tools)</li>
</ul>
<p>I currently work as a Small Group Instructor in a classroom setting. At my particular school, our students have access to Chromebooks which they use for educational instruction, as well as for leisure when they have accomplished their given tasks.</p>
<p>I feel the use of semi-personal computers is a huge benefit in the classroom. The students obviously prize use of computers in school and I feel instruction with access to computes democratizes access to computers. Now, whether or not students have access to technology at home is ameliorated.</p>
<p>With this setup, I can present infomation relating to class instruction digitally. This will make any pedagogical exercises more efficient will allow the students to directly interact with any visual exercises that I may demonstrate for their benefit. This could be slide shows, static images, infographics, simuations, demonstations, etc. The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Access to digital programs will allow the catering to the specific pedagogical sensibilities of the students. Thus, physical simulations, for example, would allow students to directly interact with physical systems to properly build up the intuition needed to understand the mathematical model undergirding it.</p></li>
<li><p>Instruction</p>
<ul>
<li>A. Includes more than one instructional technique appropriate to the objective (Mini Lesson, Group Work, Class Discussion, instructional</li>
</ul>
<p>resources, student presentation)</p>
<p>In keeping with the spirit of my ambitions for the class, I plan to be inventive in terms what instructional techniques I end up using in the classroom. While I will definitely make use of the techniques discussed above, I am not shy to create my own hybrid techniques if necessary.</p>
<p>Group works are one type of instruction that I will lean heavily on. I want students to feel as if they are part of an educational community and pursue goals thereof in a communal manner. This would invite fellow students to help each other out when they see another fellow student in need. This sort of group structue is what I truely desire and I think will invite all students to pitch in what they can fo group-oriented work.</p>
<p>I also plan to incorporate some more experimental techniques where I let students grade and assign other students a grade and present their reasoning aftewards. Basically, I want to lay down the foundation for ensuring students have a reasonable appetite for personal and professional development.</p>
<ul>
<li>B. Delivers engaging instruction: Dynamic presentation skills (e.g. voice modulation, eye contact, hand gestures) and at least one Engagement Strategy (Cold Call, Choral Response, Think-Pair-Share everybody writes, Hand Signals, whole body movement)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can expect that whatever classroom that I lead to be as engaging as is reasonably appropriate. I realize that pedagogical instruction is only as affective when one is able to impress upon the students the excitement of leaning. In order to do that, I plan to make use evocative delivery and to invoke the dynamism of motion. I want students to feel the energy and excitement I feel whenever I step into a classroom of young pupils eager to learn.</p>
<p>I will be short on specifics in this section, suffice it to say, I am a strong analyzer. I will try out different techniques and strategies for instruction and pursue those that yield the most plentiful education achievements. My approach is agile enough and adaptable on purpose.</p>
<ul>
<li>C. Asks variety of questions across Bloom’s Taxonomy</li>
</ul>
<p>While I am not the most familiar with Bloom’s Taxonomy, I have completed coursework in the past, both in grade school and in college that espoused the framework. Also, I have helped students in my current classroom finish coursework that adhered the guidelines of that particular taxonomy.</p>
<p>Not only that, my academic history of being a strong writer and reader will easily render the taxonomy accessible for any future pedagogical excusions. I am a quick learner and love pedagogical theory; I hope underscores that whatever unfamiliarity I may have with a particular theoretical tool of instruction will not mar my otherwise pristine academic record. Rest assured, Bloom’s Taxonomy will make an appearance in my prospective classroom.</p>
<ul>
<li>D. Determines whether students met the objective</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, with all that I said, I hope have expressed even a modicum of the excitement I feel for being a teacher. Truely, teaching is one of my passions. This is the case even though I have been main recipient of my pedagogical instruction. In fact, I think being a self-taught lifelong learner accrues benefits that would not have otherwise have revealed themselves. As a lover of knowledge, I spent counless hours learning arcane subjects and fatasizing about how I would instruct a hypothetical class around the subject. Always, I would think about the efficacy and enjoyment of the education excursion.</p>
<p>And it is that knowledge and experience and energy that I plan to bring with me to the classroom. I want students to be excited about learning. Learning should be fun; it’s that simple. For all the technology and efficacy in the world, it means little if you don’t see your own passion for teaching and knowledge reflected in the face of evey young pupil you instruct. It is that reflection that I intend to capture.</p>
<p>Inside every student is a scholar wanting to learn. My want to awaken and make my future pupiles cognizant of that desire. This is not just for myself but for their own futures.</p>
<p>I want to be able to interview the students on one on one settings and ask them if they feel as if they sufficiently achieved the objectives of the classroom. While that feedback may or may not ultimately factor in their grade for the classroom, what they are able to verbalize about their capacities will be a reasonable measure of how much they learned under my instruction.</p>
<p>What I lack in specifics I plan to make up with passion and excitement. I want nothing more than to serve in an educational capacity for the state of California. I assure you, I will make education in our state the envy of the world.</p></li>
